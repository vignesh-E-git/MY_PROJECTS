## Motivation
During my first sem 2 ( first year ) . my AI teacher give a homework. We can use any helping tools . the only thing is to explain what we buid during the pongal holiday.i take this as motivation to build(may be structure) my first project.and also we need to explain the project in ppt.
## Experience
- I searched so many projects in github very thing has its own advantage and disadvantage , but since this is my first project i search for a project with zero disadvantage.but eventually i understand that ***there is no project like that , we have to pick a project and we need to start working not without spending much time on choosing ideas***.
## what is the project
- it is a facial emotion classifier . it analyse the webcam face expression(original project) and classify them as one of the seven emotions ex : sad,happy,disgust,etc,.but i made a little changes to it by making it to analyse an image.
- i downloded the FER-2013 dataset from kaggle.
## how it works 
- this project has two folder : i) MODEL ii) webapp
- MODEL : it has three files
  a) modified.py
  b) pipelines.py
  c) train.py
- webapp : for ui
- first run train.py to train a model and it store the model as .hdfc .after runnig modified.py run the ui html file.
- i learned about ***using command line tools and passing argument via commandline***.
## what is use case
- if in case in future , we find a humanoid robot . this is helpful as the robot see a person and recognise its emotion and speak accordingly
## blooper 
- after forking the github project and setting up my vscode.I suddenly got stucked as the version(py 10.x) needed for the project is lower than my version(py 13.x).i spend nearly 1 and a half days to correct that part , from that i learned ***how to use different python versions using virtual environment***.
## ppt creation
- i also spend an entire day to make ppt for this project.
## github repo
